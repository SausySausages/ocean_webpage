        <p>
            The ocean covers over 70% of our planet, yet around 95% of it remains unexplored.
            As you scroll down, you will travel deeper through the major ocean zones,
            learning what lies down these deep and dark depths.
        </p>

        <p> Before you explore, here are the different zones of the ocean as you descend: </p>

        <ul>
            <li>Epipelagic (Sunlight Zone)</li>
            <li>Mesopelagic (Twilight Zone)</li>
            <li>Bathypelagic (Midnight Zone)</li>
            <li>Abyssopelagic (Abyssal Zone)</li>
            <li>Hadal (Trench Zone)</li>
        </ul>

        <p> Below is quick reference table of what the different zones of the ocean are like: </p>

        <table>
            <tr>
                <th>Ocean Zone</th>
                <th>Depth Range</th>
